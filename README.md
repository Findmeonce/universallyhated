# Peterfy — Landing Page

This repository contains a single-page marketing site for "Peterfy" — a playful SaaS concept that "turns everything into Peter Griffin." It's a static HTML/CSS/JS demo you can open locally.

How to run locally

1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or serve the directory with a simple local server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

What changed

- `index.html` — full modern SaaS landing page with hero, features, pricing, and signup form.
- `styles.css` — primary responsive stylesheet.
- `script.js` — minimal interactions: signup UX, smooth scroll, and a playful decorative effect.

Notes & license

This is a playful demo using a copyrighted character for mock/demo purposes. Replace any external images with your own assets for production.

If you want additional pages (docs, API reference, blog) or a build pipeline (Vite/Next/Gatsby), tell me which stack and I can scaffold it next.
